1. 6 bits to represent the Georgiar alphabet.

3. Memory is the RAM, data stored from a running program, deleted once program ends or shuts down. Storage is the long term data, stored in the hard disk or solid state drive.

4. A GiB is 2^30 bytes, while a GB is 10^9 bytes. 

5. The virtual memory system helps isolate processes from each in a manner similar to a hash table. By creating virtual addresses that point to physical storage, the system is able to ensure that two virtual addresses do not point to the same physical address.

6. The stack builds downwards and the heap builds upwards, so they are placed at opposite ends of the address space in order to keep the widest range of addresses open.

7. A python dictionary would be a good way to create a sparse array.

8. A context switch is when the operating system interrupts a running process, saving its state, and runs a different process.
